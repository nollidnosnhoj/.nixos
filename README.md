# My NixOS Configuration

Was very interested in NixOS so I decided to create a configuration that is similar to my Arch Linux's dotfiles.

## TODO

- Create configuration for my Framework 16 laptop.
  - Need to add conditional to the configuration for laptop-specific configurations.

I've mainly used this configuration and customized it to my liking.
